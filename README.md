# Analysis of Medicare-Registered Hospital Performance Metrics

This project is an exploratory data analysis in Python on a general hospital information dataset obtained from https://www.cms.gov/ using CMS's API. The goal of this project was to successfully load data via
an API, clean and prep the data for use in SQL and/or Tableau, and provide high-level insights regarding trends in Medicare-registered Hospitals across the United States.

# Conclusions
After pre-processing and with the additional context shown here, I'm better prepared to load this data into a SQL server or connect it to a visualization tool. I plan to use this to create a dashboard with a map of Medicare-registered hospitals and add some additional filters to create a customer-facing tool that can show users which hospitals near them have high ratings and better outcomes. My hope is that this can provide insights that improve patient outcomes by making sure that patients are going to the best hospitals near them.
